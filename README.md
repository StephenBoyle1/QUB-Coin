# QUB-Coin

This is the repository for the Queens University project which aims to... _(state your high level objective here: the **WHY**)_

## Terms
* **Instructor**: either a "lecturer" or a "demonstrator" at the Queens university who is responsible to effectively teach student during *classes*
* **Class**: either a "lecture" or a "practical", with a set of students, 1 or more instructor(s), a location and a timeline (start and end date/time)

## Scope
This project will make use of a private *Ethereum* network blockchain as its Datastore with some smart contract capabilities allowing management of digital assets.
There are a couple of digital assets to be considered as of the initial design:
* A *"general"* coin:  assigned to student when attending classes (lectures/practicals)
* A *"personal"* coin:  temporarily assigned to student that can only be transferred to either an *instructor* or a *peer* (pending approval by instructor), as a way to provide weighted feedback when support or help was provided during a class.
